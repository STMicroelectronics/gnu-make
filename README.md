## Patches

Patch                                                                | Description |
---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------- |
Fix for long path issues on Windows                                  | Windows has a limit of the number of characters in paths to files. This fix allows up to 248 characters in paths to GNU Make binary and up to 4096 characters for all files processed by the tool. Without the patch the latter limit is about 150 characters. |
